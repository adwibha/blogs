# My Medium Blog Repository  

This repository contains my blog posts, written in **Markdown**, and automatically published to **Medium** using GitHub Actions.  

## How It Works  
- Write blog posts in **Markdown** (`.md`) inside the `posts/` folder.  
- Push your changes to GitHub.  
- A GitHub Action automatically converts Markdown to **HTML** and publishes it to **Medium** using the **Medium API**.
